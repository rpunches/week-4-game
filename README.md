# week-4-game

##Crystal Collector

Computer will select a random value between 19-120.  Each crystal is given a random value between 1-12.  Each time the game starts, the game will change the value of the crystals.



##Getting Started

Click on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.   You win the game by matching your total score to the number to guess. You will lose the game if your total score goes above the number. 

##Built With
Virtual Live Code.  I used Bootstrap, JQuery and Javascript.  Downloaded images from the internet to represent my crystals and added some CSS to the HTML elements to make it look nicer.
